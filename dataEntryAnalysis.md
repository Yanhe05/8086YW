## Data Entry Analysis
### Problem
Problem For All Files

* Data row didn't specifiy which row collect from when.(e.g from day,noon,or night)
* No introduction for colour in the dataset.
* No realiable source or calculation on data analysis. eg. Under zoop, it shows Max Depth 72m but in dataset, max depth is 50
* unstable data, changing of * in H23 will cause data change for the whole file. zoop temo main
* confusing data indication. z
* No title or explaination for graph.
* Missing dataset
* No unit address in dataset 

## System Suggestion: 
I will suggest the organization to use a data collection system. Itâ€™s a computer application that facilitates the process of data collection, allowing specific, structured information to be gathered in a system fashion. It can solve the problem such as data missing, when data missing occur, system will pop up an notification to users. Also, data collection system containing detailed user input fields and data validations. 
In the potential template, Time is added as a variable to state which data set is collected from when. Also, unit is added to solve the confusion data indication.

| Date | Time | Depth(m) | Tempeture(`C) | Species | density per ml | Colony Diameter(ml) | #/L | ColonySize(mm) | Chlorophyll a |
